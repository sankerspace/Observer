How to initialize the Quartus project
=====================================

Follow this procedure whenever
  - you first open the project
  - colleagues changed something in QSYS

 1. Make sure you committed everything to git.
 
 2. Clean the repository of all unknown and ignored files. This is necessary to
    make sure Quartus uses ONLY things that are checked in and not something
    left over from earlier.
 
      $ git clean -f -d -x
 
 3. Start Quartus.

      $ quartus quartus/DE2_115_v3.qpf

 4. Start Qsys: [Tools] -> [Qsys]. Open qsys_control_system.qsys.

 6. Switch to the [Generation] tab. Click [Generate].

 7. In the [Tasks] window, select "Flow: Compilation". Double-click on
    [Analysis & Synthesis].


Troubleshooting
===============
--> QSYS won't open up? Try running
      .../quartus/sopc_builder/bin/qsys-edit
    standalone. If you get java library errors, point
      .../quartus/linux/jre
    to your system's native JRE.

--> NIOS generation "fails" but looks successful?

--> Eclipse won't start? Make sure the JRE in .../quartus/linux/jre is a 32-bit
    JRE.
