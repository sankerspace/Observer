\section{Overview of the bachelour thesis } %Section - 1.1 

In embedded real time systems it is necessary to make efforts to verify a system design.
A system design can be formalized by a mathematical specification for a dynamic system model.
One approach to verify a system design is the a deduction of the model, that shows that the design implies 
the requirements. 
In critical real time systems timing constraints are expressed with support of temporal logic, either explicit or implicit
temporal logic. 
Explicit time logic is a expression of a time variable. The time variable can be a representation of a time intervall or
it is a variable in a temporal logic. Implicit time logic (for example MTL - Metric Temporal Logic) 
is using temporal operators that constrain the extend of a state.
It is based on interval temporal logic and the duration concept.
Implicit time logic can be very usefull to express before/after relations
between concurrent actions.
Further details,reader find more information in \cite{210306}.
In runtime verification a monitor evaluates executions of 
a \textbf{System under Test(SUT)} \cite{RTFMBJ13}. 
The evaluation is formalized from a formal specification.
At ultra critical systems it is important that four major requirements will be met:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item functionality : cannot change targets behaviour
 \item certifiability: must avoid re-certification
 \item timing :	  must not interfere with the targets timing
 \item swap :     must not exhaust size, weight and power tolerance
\end{enumerate}
\newpage
The proof about this concept and the basis of my work can be read in this publication: 
``\textbf{Real-Time Runtime Verification on Chip} ''.\cite{RTFMBJ13}.\newline
A \textbf{Runtime Verification Unit(RVU)} is a possibility to aim this requirements.
It is a, seperated from SUT, synthesized hardware that monitors the execution of a SUT.\newline
The topic of my thesis ``Hardware implementation of an invariant observer'' can also be considered as a RVU, 
it evaluates the execution of a SUT and checks it for invariance.
My observer is an alternative  implementation of the invariant observer INVARIANT-SYMBOL published in \cite{RTFMBJ13},
that bypass the problem of ressource limitation and make use of the significant advantages of a high parallel
\textbf{Field Programmable Gate Array(FPGA)} hardware implementation.

\section{The Invariant Observer } %Section - 1.2


It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using `Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for `lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
