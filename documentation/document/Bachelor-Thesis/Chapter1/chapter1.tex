\section{Overview of the bachelour thesis } %Section - 1.1 

In embedded real time systems it is necessary to make efforts to verify a system design.
A system design can be formalized by a mathematical specification for a dynamic system model.
One approach to system design verification is the deduction of the model, that shows that the design implies the requirements. [Satz prüfen] 

In critical real time systems timing constraints are expressed with either explicit or implicit temporal logic.
Explicit temporal logic is an expression of a time variable. The time variable can be the representation of a time interval or a variable in temporal logic. 
Implicit temporal logic (for example MTL - Metric Temporal Logic) is using temporal operators that constrain the extend of a state.
It is based on interval temporal logic and the duration concept.
Implicit temporal logic can be very usefull to express before/after relations between concurrent actions.
For further details \cite{210306} can be a good soure of information.
In runtime verification a monitor evaluates executions of a \textbf{System under Test(SUT)} \cite{RTFMBJ13}. 
The evaluation is formalized from a formal specification.
For ultra critical systems it is important to meet four major requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item functionality : cannot change target's behaviour [prüfen]
 \item certifiability: must avoid re-certification
 \item timing :	  must not interfere with the target's timing
 \item swap :     must not exhaust size, weight and power tolerance
\end{enumerate}
\newpage
In the publication ``\textbf{Real-Time Runtime Verification on Chip} '' \cite{RTFMBJ13} this concept is described in great detail. [prüfen]\newline
A \textbf{Runtime Verification Unit(RVU)} is a verification monitor that meets that fout major requirements.[prüfen]
As part of this requirements, the RVU must seperated from SUT.
In fact it is a synthesized hardware that monitors the execution of a SUT.\newline
The topic of my thesis ``Hardware implementation of an invariant observer'' can also be considered as a RVU, 
it evaluates the execution of a SUT and checks it for invariance.
My observer is an alternative  implementation of the invariant observer INVARIANT-SYMBOL published in \cite{RTFMBJ13},
that bypass the problem of ressource limitation and make use of the significant advantages of a high parallel
\textbf{Field Programmable Gate Array(FPGA)} hardware implementation.

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using `Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for `lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
