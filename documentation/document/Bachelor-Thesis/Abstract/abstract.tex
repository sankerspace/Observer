The Invariant Observer is an approach to implement an alternative hardware realization of the invariant operation
published in the paper \textbf{Runtime Verification of Embedded Real Time Systems.}
The Invariant Observer is a Runtime Verification Unit that monitors every clock cycle a signal $\phi$ from a System under Test  and 
determines whether the signal is in an active state and it remained active at least the last $\tau$ clock cycles. \newline
If this is the case than signal $\phi$ was observed as invariant within the time interval [0,$\tau$].
