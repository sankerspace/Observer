The Invariant Observer is a Runtime Verification Unit  monitoring  a signal $\phi$ from a System under Test in real time and 
determining whether the signal was in an active state and had been active up to $\tau$ clock cycles before.
If this is the case then signal $\phi$ is observed as being invariant in the past within the time interval [0,$\tau$].\newline

In their paper  „Runtime Verification of Embedded Real Time Systems“, Reinbacher et al. \cite{RTFMBJ13}  presented a hardware implementation of an Invariant Observer. In this thesis a different hardware implementation is shown, that allows for parallel execution of several instances, leading to significant performance improvements if the time required for determining whether φ holds, is not neglectable.
