The Invariant Observer is an approach to implement an alternative hardware realization of the invariant operation
published in the paper \textbf{Runtime Verification of Embedded Real Time Systems.}
%The Invariant Observer is a Runtime Verification Unit  monitoring  a signal $\phi$ from a System under Test in real time and 
%determining whether the signal is currently in an active state and has been  active during the past $\tau$ clock cycles. \newline
The Invariant Observer is a Runtime Verification Unit  monitoring  a signal $\phi$ from a System under Test in real time and 
determining whether the signal was in an active state and had been active up to $\tau$ clock cycles before.
If this is the case then signal $\phi$ is observed as being invariant in the past within the time interval [0,$\tau$].
