\begin{abstract}
The invariant observer is an approach to implement an alternative hardware realization of the invariant operation
published in the paper \textbf{Runtime Verification of Embedded Real Time Systems.}
The invariant observer monitors at every clock cycle a signal $\phi$ from a Runtime Verification Unit and 
determines whether the signal is in an active state in the last $\tau$ clock cycles.
